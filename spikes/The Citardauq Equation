The Citardauq Equation

	Suppose that our quadratic equation has two real roots. and |4ac|
is very small compared to b^2. If we want to find the larger root, use the Quadratic Formula. For the smaller root, we get less, sometimes much less, loss of precision by using the Citardauq Formula.

This equation is found by taking the Quadratic formula and multiplying both the top and bottom by -b _+ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac).

This yields: 2c/-b -+ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac).

Cardinal sin of numerical analysis: subtracting two numbers that are very close to one another. The more similar two numbers are, the more precision you can lose from subtracting them.

To avoid loss of precision when |4ac| is very sall compared to b^2, find the larger root via the quadratic formula and find the smaller root via the citardauq formula.
